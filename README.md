# WARNING #

This only works for me. It installs plexamp and sets things up for my Raspberry Pi running Raspberry Pi OS.
I have a HiFiBerry Standard and want to run it as user "andy". It might work for you, who knows, but don't complain if it doesn't

# PlexAmp-installer for Raspberry Pi with ARM64 HW.

For more information and hardware used, see here:<br /> https://github.com/odinb/bash-plexamp-installer/wiki

Currently installs/upgrades to: Plexamp Headless v4.2.2

## Burning the image.
Burn the OS-image to the Micro-SD card using Raspberry pi imager, etcher (or app of your choice).

This will currently only work with 64-bit capable Raspberry Pi and Pi OS that is 64-bit.
Images for Bullseye can be found here:

### Enable SSH.
How to enable SSH:<br />
For security reasons, as of the November 2016 release, Raspbian OS has the SSH server disabled by default. You will have to enable it manually.
1. Mount your SD card on your computer.
2. Create or copy a file called ssh in /boot. 
On most Linux-distros, after re-mount of micro-SD-card, run: ```touch /media/$user/boot/ssh```.
On MacOS, after re-mount of micro-SD-card, run: ```touch /Volumes/boot/ssh```.

Then unmount and insert card into Raspberry Pi and boot it.

SSH access on "Raspberry Pi OS": (2022-04-04) To set up a user on first boot on headless, create a file called userconf or userconf.txt in the boot partition of the SD card.
This file should contain a single line of text, consisting of username:encrypted-password – so your desired username, followed immediately by a colon, followed immediately by an encrypted representation of the password you want to use.

To generate the encrypted password, the easiest way is to use OpenSSL on a Raspberry Pi that is already running (or most any linux you have running) – open a terminal window and enter:
```echo ‘mypassword’ | openssl passwd -6 -stdin```

This will produce what looks like a string of random characters, which is actually an encrypted version of the supplied password.<br />

SSH access on "DietPi OS": User/pass: root/dietpi<br />

After SSH-ing to the SBC, on the "Raspberry Pi OS", change to root (```sudo -i```) and run script with:

```bash <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/odinb/bash-plexamp-installer/main/install_Plexamp_pi.sh)```

### Post-install and post-reboot tasks
After reboot, as your regular user please run the command:

```node /home/USER/plexamp/js/index.js```
where USER is your user, normally pi.
At this point, go to the URL provided in response, and enter the claim token at prompt.

Once entered, the web-GUI should be available on the ip-of-plexamp-pi:32500 from a browser.
On that GUI you will be asked to login to your Plex-acoount for security-reasons,
and then choose a library where to fetch/stream music from.

Now play some music! Or control it from any other instance of Plexamp.

Start and enable the Plexamp service if you feel like having it start on boot!
Hit ctrl+c to stop process, then enter:

```systemctl --user enable plexamp.service && systemctl --user start plexamp.service```

### Re-running the script

The script can be re-run to fix configuration/setup errors, just say no/bypass the sections you do not want to re-run!

If there is a new version, and script has been updated, you can upgrade by re-running the script, and reboot.

For hostname-change, please make sure to reboot in-between, or you might face issues.

### Q & A

Q: The rPi will show up in my cast list. However the moment I select a song to play, it either keeps loading forever (black screen with loading circle) or it flips back to the album overview without starting the selected song. This is the case for all file types tried.

A: Go into the plexamp settings (via the web UI) and select the right audio output device. Rebooting the rPI a second time sometimes also helps (or restarting/veirfying the PlexAmp service), this of course will only help if correct audio device is already chosen.
(```systemctl --user restart plexamp.service && systemctl --user status plexamp.service```)
